  ### Premium Return
  CoFund Products distinguish themselves by offering higher returns than other real estate investment funds, an achievement rooted in our commitment to sharing a greater portion of profits with our investors. Before the inception of CoFund, we were a small to mid-sized developer in Toronto, primarily utilizing our own capital for land acquisition and development. This experience led to a profound realization: it's more advantageous to focus on expanding the overall scale rather than just chasing higher yields on an existing base. We are confident that this strategy of scaling up will ultimately result in more substantial returns for both us and our investors.

  The majority of the CoFund Core Team comes from a background in real estate development, which gives us a comprehensive understanding of the entire life cycle of real estate projects.

Our extensive knowledge and experience in real estate development, construction, and property management bolster our confidence in delivering superior results compared to other real estate investment funds in the industry.

  ### Proactive Growth
  Rather than passively waiting, CoFund proactively explores ways to enhance value to its properties. Leveraging our extensive development experience, we deploy a wide range of tools, processes, and methods that are standard among professional developers and builders, aimed at maximizing the potential of our properties. Our approach includes, but is not limited to, improved site planning, re-zoning, subdivision, pursuing Minister's Zoning Order (MZO), obtaining Local Planning Appeal Tribunal (LPAT) approvals, and general construction activities.

  ### Data Driven
  At CoFund, being data-driven is fundamental to our culture. We base all critical decisions on comprehensive data analysis. We invest heavily in data technologies, surpassing many other organizations in the industry. Our data research is extensive, achieved through partnerships with multiple renowned data vendors, combined with our in-house data analysis system, LREDE© (Legend Real Estate Data Engine), enables us to monitor a broad spectrum of factors. These include real estate market dynamics like housing and land prices, supply and demand, construction materials, and labor costs. Additionally, we also track economic indicators that significantly impact the real estate market, such as interest rates, CPI(s), employment rates, household income, equity indices, and foreign exchange rates.

  ### Transparency
  Our information and results are prominently displayed on our website. Through the CoFund Investor Portal, you can access real-time updates, including Asset Portfolios, Appraisal Reports, Project Milestones, Notices and Keynotes from Investor Meetings, Interim Financial Statements, Annual Reports, Applicable Tax Forms, as well as General Customer Support and Q&As, among other resources.
