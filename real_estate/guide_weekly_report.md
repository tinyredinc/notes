# Guide for Weekly Report - v240614 RED

This mechanism for weekly report and meeting, derived from the concepts of Scrum Master and Agile Management, is designed to balance management and reporting overhead. It is optimized for universal application across all types of organizations and is ideally suited for groups of fewer than 10 people. For groups larger than 10, implementing a management hierarchy is recommended to ensure efficient reporting. 


## STRUCTURE 

The weekly report should answer and only answer three key questions:

1. What was accomplished in the LAST WEEK?
    - Up to 3 most significant accomplishment in bullet points.

2. What are the plans for the THIS WEEK?
    - Up to 3 most significant task in bullet points.

3. Are there any roadblocks?
    - Roadblocks refer to challenges that cannot be resolved independently.


## FAQ

1. Can I answer these questions in paragraphs?
    - No, responses should be lean, summarized, and abstract, presented in bullet points. Avoid long paragraphs and even complete sentences for clarity and brevity.

2. Can I report for more than 3 items?
    - In general, you should not. Your reports should concentrate on the most significant tasks, particularly those that are either notably time-consuming or critically important. Exclude routine and ad hoc tasks, like sending emails to clients. According to management theory, the top three significant tasks should account for at least 50% of an employee's work hours in a typical week. If this is not the case, it may indicate a lack of focus and a tendency to be overly distracted by miscellaneous activities. This situation is common in startup teams, where chaos can often happen. This has to be addressing in the long run for maintaining productivity and staying focus.

3. When should I submit my Weekly Report?
    - The Weekly Report should be integrated with the Weekly Meeting, allowing for alignment of questions, answers, roadblocks, and plans across the organization. Therefore, you should prepare your Weekly Report before the Weekly Meeting and submit it afterward, given that your plans for the next week may adjust based on discussions during the meeting. If there is no Weekly Meeting scheduled for a particular week, submission should be completed at the beginning of that week.
