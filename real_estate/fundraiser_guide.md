## Engagement Protection

Once an investor's registration is finalized, COSTONE GROUP protects the commission and all related benefits for our fundraising partners. This protection lasts for an initial period of 90 days and extends for an additional 30 days from their last touchpoint concerning the investments.

Consider a scenario where Alice (a fundraising partner) introduces Bob (a potential investor) to COSTONE GROUP and also finalizes his investor profile registration:

* Eg1. Alice doesn't have any further communication with Bob after that, yet Bob decides to invest on the 89th day, Alice will still be entitled to the full commission and associated benefits from Bob's transaction.

* Eg2. Alice follows up with Bob every month. If, after a year, Bob decides to invest and Alice can verify her recent interactions with Bob about the investment (within the past 30 days), she will receive the full commission and all benefits resulting from Bob's transaction.

* Eg3.  If Alice can't convince Bob to invest and gives up, and another fundraising partner successfully brings Bob in 6 months later to commit, Alice won't receive benefits from Bob's transaction due to expired Engagement Protection.


## Co-Agency

COSTONE GROUP believes that individuals qualifying as our fundraising partners should possess the capability to develop and build investor relationships independently. As such, we do not officially recognize or support any co-agency or multi-layer agency structures. The person who introduces a potential investor to us and simultaneously completes the investor profile registration will be considered the exclusive representative of that particular client. Consequently, all commissions and benefits will be delivered to that individual.

Consider a scenario in which Alice (a fundraising partner) introduces Cindy(another fundraising partner) to COSTONE GROUP. Alice mentions that they are friends and partners, planning to split the commission equally. Later on, Cindy introduces Bob (a potential investor) to COSTONE GROUP and persuades him to invest. The full commission from Bob's transaction will be given to Cindy, and it will be her sole responsibility to handle any further distribution.

Howerver, helping us bring more high-performance fundraising partners on board is greatly appreciated, and those who contribute will be rewarded for enhancing our fundraising network.
