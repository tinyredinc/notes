## Engagement Protection

Once an investor's registration is finalized, COSTONE GROUP protects the commission and all related benefits for our fundraising partners. This protection lasts for an initial period of 90 days and extends for an additional 30 days from their last touchpoint concerning the investments.

Consider a scenario where Alice (a fundraising partner) introduces Bob (a potential investor) to COSTONE GROUP and also finalizes his investor profile registration:

* Eg1. Alice doesn't have any further communication with Bob after that, yet Bob decides to invest on the 89th day, Alice will still be entitled to the full commission and associated benefits from Bob's transaction.

* Eg2. Alice follows up with Bob every month. If, after a year, Bob decides to invest and Alice can verify her recent interactions with Bob about the investment (within the past 30 days), she will receive the full commission and all benefits resulting from Bob's transaction.

* Eg3.  If Alice can't convince Bob to invest and gives up, and another fundraising partner successfully brings Bob in 6 months later to commit, Alice won't receive benefits from Bob's transaction due to expired Engagement Protection.
