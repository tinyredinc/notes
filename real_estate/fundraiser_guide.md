Version: 20230911

## Lead to Deal

From leads (potential investors) to deals, we break down the conversion procedure into 5 stages:

**Stage I - Lead**  
In the early stage, the Fundraising Partner should focus on building a healthy relationship with the potential investor and studying their investment preferences. Here's a sample todo list for reference:  

1. Gather information for investor profile registration.
2. Introduce COSTONE GROUP to the investor.
3. Promote the appropriate investment project/product.
4. Answer basic questions about the designated project/product.
5. Schedule an appointment with COSTONE GROUP.

**Stage II - Appointment**  
During further communication, both the Fundraising Partner and COSTONE GROUP should collaborate to help the investor gain an in-depth understanding of the project/product. Here's a sample checklist for reference:  

1. Sign NDA and NCA documents with COSTONE GROUP.
2. Complete the Investor Profile Registration (ownership protected).
3. Conduct a comprehensive presentation about the project/product.
4. Provide the complete information package for the project/product.

**Stage III - Due Diligence**  
During this stage, the Fundraising Partner and COSTONE GROUP should collaborate to help the investor complete their due diligence. This process might involve visiting the underlying property and coordinating the required meetings. Below is a checklist to ensure a comprehensive due diligence process:

1. Ensure that the general information is accurate.
2. Ensure that the overall plan is feasible.
3. Ensure that the projections are reasonable.
4. Ensure that the calculations are precise.
5. Ensure the investment terms are fair.

**Stage IV - Commitment**
Once the investor completes their due diligence and commits to make an investment, several procedural tasks need to be addressed:

1. Sign the Commission Agreement (between the Fundraising Partner and COSTONE GROUP).
2. Sign the Investment Term Sheet (between COSTONE GROUP and the Investor).
3. Make a deposit of 10-20% to the designated Lawyer Trust Account.
4. Prepare the remaining funds in anticipation of the capital call.

**Stage V - Deal**  
This marks the culmination of the "Lead to Deal" workflow. Upon reaching this stage, a potential lead formally becomes our financial investor. They will proactively monitor the project's progress and collectively benefit from the growth of our premium-quality projects.

1. Sign the official Investor Subscription Agreement.
2. Ensure all funds are in place following the capital call.
3. Disburse the commission to the Fundraising Partner as per the agreement.

## Investor Registration

Fundraising Partners should prioritize completing the investor registration to establish ownership of the customer. Typically, Fundraising Partners should have a thorough understanding and a healthy relationship with their clients and be prepared to provide the following information:

*Before registering an investor, a status check is required. If a specific investor is already on file with 'engagement protection' status, the registration will be denied.

## Engagement Protection

Once an investor's registration is finalized, COSTONE GROUP protects the commission and all related benefits for our fundraising partners. This protection lasts for an initial period of 90 days and extends for an additional 30 days from their last touchpoint concerning the investments.

Consider a scenario where Alice (a fundraising partner) introduces Bob (a potential investor) to COSTONE GROUP and also finalizes his investor profile registration:

* Eg1. Alice doesn't have any further communication with Bob after that, yet Bob decides to invest on the 89th day, Alice will still be entitled to the full commission and associated benefits from Bob's transaction.

* Eg2. Alice follows up with Bob every month. If, after a year, Bob decides to invest and Alice can verify her recent interactions with Bob about the investment (within the past 30 days), she will receive the full commission and all benefits resulting from Bob's transaction.

* Eg3.  If Alice can't convince Bob to invest and gives up, and another fundraising partner successfully brings Bob in 6 months later to commit, Alice won't receive benefits from Bob's transaction due to expired Engagement Protection.


## Co-Agency

Helping us bring more high-performance fundraising partners on board is greatly appreciated, and those who contribute will be rewarded for enhancing our fundraising network.

Howerver, COSTONE GROUP believes that individuals qualifying as our fundraising partners should possess the capability to develop and build investor relationships independently. As such, we do not officially recognize or support any co-agency or multi-layer agency structures. The person who introduces a potential investor to us and simultaneously completes the investor profile registration will be considered the exclusive representative of that particular client. Consequently, all commissions and benefits will be delivered to that individual.

Consider a scenario in which Alice (a fundraising partner) introduces Cindy(another fundraising partner) to COSTONE GROUP. Alice mentions that they are friends and partners, planning to split the commission equally. Later on, Cindy introduces Bob (a potential investor) to COSTONE GROUP and persuades him to invest. The full commission from Bob's transaction will be given to Cindy, and it will be her sole responsibility to handle any further distribution.


## Commission

Fundraising commissions are influenced by a range of factors, including project quality, investment term, market conditions, interest rates, and urgency levels, among others. To ensure that our Fundraising Partners receive competitive and fair compensation, we obtain quotations from various Exempt Market Dealers (EMDs) for each specific product and adjust our commission rate to match the median rate offered.

Fundraising commissions are usually paid using an M + N structure, where M is a percentage of the funds raised, disbursed upon receipt of the investment, and N is a percentage of the funds raised, paid upon the project's completion.

For fundraising partners deeply committed to a project's growth potential, there is usually an option to waive a portion or even all of their commission in exchange for Limited Partner (LP) shares, General Partner (GP) shares, or Management Common shares. Terms and conditions may vary depending on the specific project or product.

For example, as of August 2023, for the 4800 Sheppard Plaza MCR Development Project, we received quotations from three well-known Exempt Market Dealers(EMD) in Toronto. These dealers typically request a total commission of 5%, payable in either a 4% + 1% or a 3% + 2% structure.
