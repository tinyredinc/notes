## The Solution Provider - Teranet

Teranet, the operator of both Geowarehouse and OnLand, was established in 1991. Initially owned by the Government of Ontario, it was later acquired by OMERS (one of Canada's largest defined benefit pension plans) in 2008. In 2010, Teranet expanded its agreements with the Province of Ontario, securing a partnership for an additional 50 years.


## The Amount $2 Dollars

In English law, as well as in other jurisdictions with similar common law systems, a legal contract requires that each party provide consideration. The nominal amount of $2 is often used in legal documents, not to signify the value of a transaction, but as token consideration to satisfy the legal requirements for a contract or agreement to be valid. Common applications include:

- Granting easements, rights of way, or in specific licensing or service agreements.
- Transferring assets or shares within affiliated companies without a real exchange of money.
- Also seen in peppercorn leases, settlement agreements, and transfers among family members.
