# Official Plan & Secondary Plan

For urban planning and real estate development, "Official Plans" and "Secondary Plans" serve different but complementary roles in guiding land use and development. The Official Plan provides the overarching vision and policy framework for the entire municipality, while Secondary Plans offer detailed, localized planning policies for specific areas within the municipality, allowing for more tailored and nuanced approaches to development and land use planning. Here's a general overview of the differences:


## Official Plan

- Broad Scope
    - An Official Plan is a statutory document that outlines a municipality's general policies for future land use. It covers a wide range of areas within a municipality and sets long-term goals and objectives for all aspects of community growth and development, including residential, commercial, industrial, and recreational land uses.

- Guiding Framework
    - It serves as a blueprint for the development and management of communities over time, guiding public policy in land use planning, transportation, infrastructure development, and environmental stewardship.

- Legally Binding
    - Once approved by the relevant governmental authority, an Official Plan has legal status. All by-laws, including zoning by-laws, and development must conform to the Official Plan. However, it is more about guiding principles than specific details.

- Public Consultation
    - The development of an Official Plan involves significant public consultation, stakeholder engagement, and often approval by a higher level of government, such as a regional or provincial authority.


## Secondary Plan
- Focused Detail
    - A Secondary Plan is a more detailed plan that focuses on a specific area within the municipality, often to guide development in areas undergoing significant change or with unique characteristics. It builds on the broader policies of the Official Plan, providing more detailed guidelines and standards.

- Area-Specific Policies
    - These plans can include specific land use designations, density targets, urban design guidelines, infrastructure requirements, and other area-specific policies that are tailored to the unique needs and opportunities of the specific area.

- Implementation Tool
    - Secondary Plans are important tools for implementing the vision and policies of the Official Plan at a more detailed and localized level. They can be used to guide development in new communities, redevelopment areas, or areas requiring special consideration.
    
- Also Legally Binding
    - Like the Official Plan, once adopted, a Secondary Plan also has legal status and informs the review of development applications, zoning by-laws amendments, and other planning decisions within the specific area it covers.
