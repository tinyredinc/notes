# Financial Advisor Framework Agreement
Version: 20231127

This Framework Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into by and between the undersigned Financial Advisor ("Advisor") and COSTONE GROUP ("Company"), and sets forth the terms and conditions governing the Advisor's affiliation with the Company. By signing this Agreement, the Advisor expressly agrees to comply with the policies, processes, and standards herein defined.

WHEREAS, the Advisor is engaged in providing financial advisory services; and

WHEREAS, the Company is engaged in various investment and development projects and seeks to utilize the services of the Advisor;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

## Engagement Process

The Financial Advisor shall follow the prescribed conversion process from potential investors to finalized deals, segmented into five stages as detailed below:

### Stage I - Lead

Initially, the Financial Advisor is tasked with establishing a robust relationship with the potential investor and assessing their investment preferences. The following actions should be undertaken for reference:

1. Collect necessary information for the investor's profile registration.
2. Introduce the investor to COSTONE GROUP.
3. Advocate for the relevant investment project/product.
4. Provide responses to fundamental inquiries regarding the specified project/product.
5. Coordinate an appointment with COSTONE GROUP representatives.

### Stage II - Appointment

During subsequent interactions, both the Financial Advisor and COSTONE GROUP are required to collaboratively facilitate the investor's comprehensive understanding of the project/product. Recommended actions include:

1. Execution of Non-Disclosure and Non-Compete Agreements with COSTONE GROUP.
2. Finalization of the Investor Profile Registration, ensuring ownership protection.
3. Delivery of an exhaustive presentation detailing the project/product.
4. Provision of a complete informational package pertaining to the project/product.

### Stage III - Due Diligence

In this phase, the Financial Advisor and COSTONE GROUP must jointly assist the investor in completing their due diligence. This may encompass property visits and coordination of essential meetings. The following checklist is provided to ensure thoroughness in the due diligence process:

1. Verification of the accuracy of general information.
2. Confirmation of the feasibility of the overall plan.
3. Assessment of the reasonableness of projections.
4. Precision in all relevant calculations.
5. Evaluation of the fairness of investment terms.

### Stage IV - Commitment

Post due diligence, upon the investor's commitment to invest, several procedural steps are necessitated:

1. Execution of the Commission Agreement between the Financial Advisor and COSTONE GROUP.
2. Signing of the Investment Term Sheet between COSTONE GROUP and the Investor.
3. Deposition of 10-20% into the designated Lawyer Trust Account.
4. Arrangement of the remaining funds in preparation for the capital call.

### Stage V - Finalization

This stage signifies the completion of the 'Engagement Process'. Here, a prospective lead formally transitions into a financial investor. They are expected to actively monitor the project's progress and benefit from the development of our high-quality projects.

1. Signing of the official Investor Subscription Agreement.
2. Confirmation that all funds are secured post-capital call.
3. Allocation of the commission to the Financial Advisor as stipulated in the agreement.

### Investor Registration

It is incumbent upon Financial Advisors to complete investor registration promptly to establish client ownership. Financial Advisors are expected to possess a comprehensive understanding and maintain a robust relationship with their clients. The following information is required for registration:

- Full Name: Only complete names are acceptable; nicknames or partial names are not permitted.
- Contact Information: At least two forms of contact should be provided, such as phone number, email address, or social media application.
- Background: A concise summary of the investorâ€™s education, career, family background, lifestyle, etc.
- Funding: Detailed insights into the status and scale of the investor's available capital for investment purposes.
- Knowledge Level: An evaluation of the investor's understanding and experience in real estate development:
  - Expert: Involvement in real estate projects as a builder or developer.
  - Advanced: Participation in real estate projects as a financial investor.
  - Basic: Experience in real estate as a landlord.
  - Novice: No prior real estate investment experience.
- Preferred Asset: Identification of the types of properties of greatest interest to the investor, such as:
  - Low Density Residential (e.g., Detached, Semi-Detached, Townhouse)
  - High Density Residential (e.g., Condominiums, Multi-Unit Residential Towers)
  - Industrial (e.g., Warehouse, Manufacturing Factory)
  - Residential Rental (e.g., Student Housing, Apartment Rentals, Retirement Residences)
  - Commercial Rental (e.g., Retail Plazas, Shopping Malls, Office Buildings)
  - Recreational (e.g., Resorts, Hotels, Golf Courses, Marinas)
- Yield Expectation: The anticipated level of return:
  - Conservative: Annualized ROI closely aligned with the Prime Rate plus a margin.
  - Moderate: Annualized ROI between 12% and 20%.
  - Aggressive: Annualized ROI exceeding 20%.
- Risk Bias: The investor's risk tolerance in relation to yield expectations:
  - Conservative: Emphasis on principal safety.
  - Moderate: A balance between security and returns.
  - Aggressive: Openness to risking a portion of the principal for higher yields.
  - Speculative: Willingness to engage with high market volatility (e.g., cryptocurrency investments).

Note: A preliminary status check is mandatory prior to investor registration. Should an investor already possess 'engagement protection' status within our records, further registration attempts will be nullified.

## Engagement Protection

Upon the completion of an investor's registration, COSTONE GROUP shall ensure the protection of commissions and all associated benefits accorded to our Financial Advisors. This protection shall remain in effect for an initial term of 180 calendar days and shall be extended by an additional 90 calendar days subsequent to the most recent investment-related interaction. In instances where a financial advisor successfully convinces an investor to commit funds, the duration of engagement protection shall be extended to 1800 calendar days commencing from the date of the Subscription Agreement.

Illustrative scenarios include:

- Scenario 1: Alice, a Financial Advisor, ceases communication with Bob, a potential investor, after registering him. If Bob elects to invest on the 179th day post-registration, Alice retains her entitlement to the full commission and corresponding benefits from Bob's investment.

- Scenario 2: Should Alice conduct periodic follow-ups with Bob and, subsequently, if Bob decides to invest after a year, Alice shall be entitled to receive the full commission and all resultant benefits from Bob's investment. This entitlement is contingent upon providing evidence of interactions between Alice and Bob regarding the investment within the 90 days prior to Bob's investment decision.

- Scenario 3: In the event that Alice discontinues her efforts to secure Bob's investment and another Financial Advisor successfully facilitates Bob's investment commitment 180 days later, Alice will not be eligible to receive any benefits from Bob's investment, due to the lapse of her Engagement Protection period.

In the event of a dispute between financial advisors regarding representation of an investor, each advisor must furnish evidence of their investment-related interactions with the investor. Acceptable forms of proof include call logs, text message records, social media chat histories, and email correspondences. COSTONE GROUP shall render the final judgment based on the presented evidence, adhering strictly to the rules of investor registration and engagement protection.

## Commission

The determination of fundraising commissions is subject to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, project quality, investment duration, prevailing market conditions, interest rates, and levels of urgency. To ensure that our Financial Advisors are remunerated competitively and equitably, COSTONE GROUP procures quotations from diverse Exempt Market Dealers (EMDs) for each distinct product. Subsequently, we calibrate our commission rates to align with the median rate proposed.

Typically, fundraising commissions are disbursed utilizing an M + N structure. Here, 'M' represents a percentage of the funds raised, allocated to the Financial Advisor upon receipt of the investment. 'N' denotes a percentage of the funds raised, payable upon the fruition of the project.

For instance, in the context of the 4800 Sheppard Plaza MCR Development Project as of August 2023, quotations were sourced from three renowned Exempt Market Dealers (EMD) based in Toronto. These dealers commonly propose a total commission of 5%, structured either as 4% + 1% or 3% + 2%.

Financial Advisors who demonstrate a profound commitment to the potential growth of a project are often presented with the option to forgo a part or the entirety of their commission in exchange for Limited Partner (LP) shares. The specific terms and conditions of such exchanges may vary, contingent upon the particularities of the project or product at hand.

## Co-Agency

COSTONE GROUP asserts that individuals designated as our Financial Advisors should demonstrate the ability to independently cultivate and sustain investor relationships. In accordance with this principle, we do not formally acknowledge or endorse any form of co-agency. The Financial Advisor who introduces a potential investor to COSTONE GROUP and concurrently finalizes the investor's profile registration shall be deemed the sole representative for that investor. As a consequence, all commissions and associated benefits pertaining to that investor's transactions will be conferred exclusively to the registering Financial Advisor.

By way of illustration, consider the case of Alice and Cindy, who are both affiliated as Financial Advisors with COSTONE GROUP and collaborate as friends and partners. They purport to be jointly managing a client, Bob, and have concurred to divide the commission from Bob's transaction equally. However, given that COSTONE GROUP's policy does not formally recognize co-agency, Bob's registration has been completed under a single advisor's name, specifically Cindy's in this instance. Therefore, the entirety of the commission arising from Bob's engagement will be allocated to Cindy. Subsequently, it is Cindy's sole responsibility to administer any further distribution of this commission.

## Referral Bonus

COSTONE GROUP values the contribution of individuals who assist in recruiting high-performance Financial Advisors and is committed to rewarding such efforts that facilitate the expansion of our funding network. The forms of bonuses for facilitating Financial Advisor recruitment are subject to variation from time to time and depend on the specifics of each distinct product.

## Confidentiality

The Financial Advisor agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all proprietary information received from COSTONE GROUP and its clients during the course of this Agreement and for a period of two years following its termination.

## Independent Contractor

The Financial Advisor shall act as an independent contractor and not as an employee, agent, partner, or joint venturer of COSTONE GROUP. Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as creating an employment relationship between COSTONE GROUP and the Financial Advisor.

## Term and Termination

The Agreement shall commence upon the date of execution and shall continue in effect until either 1) the lapse of one calendar year from the date of signing, or 2) its termination by either party upon providing thirty (30) days' written notice. Furthermore, either party retains the right to terminate this Agreement.

## Governing Law

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of Canada applicable therein.

## Dispute Resolution

Any disputes arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be resolved through final and binding arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Act of Ontario.

## Entire Agreement

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.

## Amendment

Amendments are anticipated to be appended to this Framework Agreement, detailing specific compensation packages for the fundraising activities conducted by financial advisors for various projects. No amendment to this Agreement shall be deemed effective unless it is executed in writing and duly signed by both parties.

## Severability

If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed, and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the last date written below.

 Share => Move to Amendament

COSTONE GROUP values the contribution of individuals who assist in recruiting high-performance Financial Advisors and is committed to rewarding such efforts that facilitate the expansion of our funding network. The compensation structure for fundraising endeavors typically encompasses two elements: a cash commission and a bonus share. The composition of the bonus share may include General Partner (GP) shares or Management Common shares, subject to variations based on specific project parameters. The Financial Advisor who successfully concludes a transaction shall retain the entirety of the cash commission. Nevertheless, they are contractually obligated to distribute half of the bonus share to the Financial Advisor who facilitated their introduction to COSTONE GROUP.

To illustrate, consider the scenario where Alice, a Financial Advisor, successfully refers Cindy, another Financial Advisor, to the COSTONE GROUP funding network. Subsequently, Cindy executes a transaction that yields a 4% cash commission and 1% in Bonus General Partner (GP) shares associated with the project. While Cindy is entitled to the full 4% cash commission, she is contractually bound to transfer 0.5% of her Bonus General Partner (GP) shares from the project to Alice, in recognition of Alice's referral role in her induction into the funding network.
