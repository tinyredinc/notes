- Phase 1. Siteplan Approval
  - Subdivision of the master land into parcels (lots), and detailed site layouts are reviewed and approved by the government.

- Phase 2. Land Service
  - Preparation of raw land for construction by providing infrastructure such as grading, roads, utilities, and drainage.

- Phase 3. Warehouse Construction
  - Construction of two condo industrial buildings, comprising a total of 20 units and 108,216 sqft of GFA.

*Pre-sales will be launched after site plan approval.
