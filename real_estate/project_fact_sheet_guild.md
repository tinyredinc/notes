# Fact Sheet Guide for Real Estate Development Project

A Fact Sheet is a 1-2 pages summary containing abstract information about a project. It's typically formatted in portrait orientation and can be printed on letter-sized paper. This guide uses the "Stouffville/Uxbridge Condo Warehouse Project" as an example to illustrate how to compile a Fact Sheet for a Real Estate Development Project.

## Project Plan

- Current Status: The master parcel was successfully re-zoned from "Major Open Space" to "Rural Industrial (M1)" through LPAT in December 2020. Given its former use as farmland, certain land servicing tasks, such as grading, road construction, and utilities, need to be completed before construction can start.

- Phase 1. Siteplan Approval
  - Subdivision of the master parcel into individual lots, with detailed site layouts subsequently reviewed and approved by the government.

- Phase 2. Land Service
  - Preparation of raw land for construction by providing infrastructure such as grading, roads, utilities, and drainage.

- Phase 3. Warehouse Construction
  - Construction of two condo industrial buildings, together offering a total of 20 units and 108,216 sqft of GFA.

*Pre-sales are set to launch following site plan approval.
