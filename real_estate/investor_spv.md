# REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT SPV

This Investment SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) is designed to enable individual investors with limited investment capacity to own and benefit from one or more income-generating properties or development projects on track to become such assets. These properties may include multi-residential buildings, condo industrial warehouses, commercial plazas, and more.

This document serves as a guideline for legal experts to establish such a structure. The contents enclosed within [square brackets] are placeholders where NAMES, DATES, and NUMBERS should be inserted according to specific requirements.

It's important to note that implementing such a structure using corporate entities (or companies) is not considered tax-efficient within Ontario's jurisdiction. Replacing all instances of "INC." with a GP/LP partnership or a Trust could establish a tax flow-through structure. This change may offer improved tax efficiency but might also lead to higher implementation costs and increased complexity.

All terms and conditions related to investment returns shall be expressly defined within this Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), acting as an isolation layer.

The agreement should incorporate the following key terms:

- Class of Shares - Three classes of shares shall be issued.

    - Class A - Common Share

        - Endowed with full voting rights and designated for [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INC.], the Class A common share assigns the shareholder the responsibility of providing specified investor services to holders of Preferred Shares. This includes issuing cash distributions and providing reports and tax forms. Costs associated with these services are reimbursable but must not exceed [2%] of the total revenue. In the event of cost overruns, the management company is required to cover any shortfall.

    - Class B - Preferred Share (Fixed Return)

        - With no voting rights, Class B preferred shares are designated for investors seeking a fixed investment return. Investors holding Class B preferred shares will receive a fixed [n%] return on cash distributions, non-compounding annually, and disbursed [quarterly].

        - In the event that the underlying [INCOME GENERATING PROPERTY] underperforms and does not generate sufficient net income to cover the fixed return for Class B preferred share investors, it is the responsibility of [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INC.] to cover the shortfall. Conversely, should the [INCOME GENERATING PROPERTY] overperform, resulting in excess net income beyond the fixed return for Class B preferred share investors, [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INC.] is entitled to retain the surplus.

    - Class C - Preferred Share (Variable Return)

        - With no voting rights, Class C preferred shares are designated for investors seeking for a variable investment return. Investors with Class C preferred shares are entitled to a variable return on cash distributions, reflective of the performance and net income of the underlying [INCOME GENERATING PROPERTY].

-  Issuance of Shares - The total number of shares issued, encompassing all classes, should correspond to the quantity of common shares that [INVESTMENT SPV INC.] owns in [PROPERTY HOLDING INC.]. For example, if [INVESTMENT SPV INC.] owns 20,000 out of 41,000 common shares in [PROPERTY HOLDING INC.], then [INVESTMENT SPV INC.] should issue a total of 20,000 shares across all classes. Preferred Shares may be issued at varying prices, contingent upon the timing and scale of investment; however, the rights attributed to each share class shall remain consistent.

- Order of Priority - In the event of liquidation, the liquidation preference ensures that investors with Class B and Class C (Preferred Share) see their investment principal prioritized over [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INC.], which possesses Class A (Common Share). In the scenario where assets remain post the settlement of all investment principal, the residual profits will be allocated among all three classes in accordance with their respective share percentages.

- Share Transfer - Investors in possession of Class B and Class C preferred shares are prohibited from transferring their shares without the express consent of [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INC.]. Correspondingly, [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INC.] holds the primary right of purchase at the same rate. Should [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INC.] decline this option, other existing preferred shareholders are granted secondary priority to purchase the shares. If neither party opts to acquire them, the preferred shares may then be offered for sale on the open market.
