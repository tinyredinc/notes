# REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT SPV

This Investment SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) is designed to enable individual investors with limited investment capacity to own and benefit from one or more income-generating properties or development projects on track to become such assets. These properties may include multi-residential buildings, condo industrial warehouses, commercial plazas, and more.

This document serves as a guideline for legal experts to establish such a structure. The contents enclosed within [square brackets] are placeholders where NAMES, DATES, and NUMBERS should be inserted according to specific requirements.

It's important to note that implementing such a structure using corporate entities (or companies) is not considered tax-efficient within Ontario's jurisdiction. Replacing all instances of "INC." with a GP/LP partnership or a Trust could establish a tax flow-through structure. This change may offer improved tax efficiency but might also lead to higher implementation costs and increased complexity.

### 9. Shareholder Agreement of [INVESTMENT SPV INC.]

All terms and conditions related to investment returns shall be expressly defined within this Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), acting as an isolation layer.

The agreement should incorporate the following key terms:

- Class of Shares - Two classes of shares shall be issued.

    - Class A - Common Share

        - Endowed with full voting rights and designated for [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INC.], are entitled to a variable return on cash distributions, reflective of the performance and net income of the underlying [INCOME GENERATING PROPERTY].

    - Class B - Preferred Share

        - With no voting rights, investors with Class B preferred shares are entitled to a variable return on cash distributions, reflective of the performance and net income of the underlying [INCOME GENERATING PROPERTY].

- Liquidation Priority: In the event of liquidation, the liquidation preference ensures that investors with Class B Preferred Share see their investment principal prioritized over [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INC.], which possesses Class A (Common Share). In the scenario where assets remain post the settlement of all investment principal, the residual profits will be allocated among all classes in accordance with their respective share percentages.

- Issuance of Shares: The total number of shares issued, encompassing all classes, should correspond to the quantity of common shares that [INVESTMENT SPV INC.] owns in [PROPERTY HOLDING INC.].

Preferred Shares may be issued at varying prices, contingent upon the timing and scale of investment; however, the rights attributed to each share class shall remain consistent.

- Investment Management: [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INC.] is engaged as the investment management company for [INVESTMENT SPV INC.], tasked with delivering investor services to shareholders. These services encompass the issuance of cash distributions, as well as the providing reports and tax forms.

Should the costs incurred surpass this threshold, it shall be incumbent upon the management company to address and finance the resultant shortfall.

- Share Transfer: Investors in possession of Class B preferred shares are prohibited from transferring their shares without the express consent of [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INC.]. Correspondingly, [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INC.] holds the primary right of purchase at the same rate. Should [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INC.] decline this option, other existing shareholders are granted secondary priority to purchase the shares. If neither party opts to acquire them, the preferred shares may then be offered for sale on the open market.

- Monthly Distribution: [INVESTMENT SPV INC.] has no provision for retain earnings; hence, all net income is required to be fully distributed to its shareholders on a monthly basis. The designated date for such distributions shall be the 15th of each month.
