# REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT SPV

This Investment SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) is designed to enable individual investors with limited investment capacity to own and benefit from one or more income-generating properties or development projects on track to become such assets. These properties may include multi-residential buildings, condo industrial warehouses, commercial plazas, and more.

This document serves as a guideline for legal experts to establish such a structure. The contents enclosed within [square brackets] are placeholders where NAMES, DATES, and NUMBERS should be inserted according to specific requirements.

It's important to note that implementing such a structure using corporate entities (or companies) is not considered tax-efficient within Ontario's jurisdiction. Replacing all instances of "INC." with a GP/LP partnership or a Trust could establish a tax flow-through structure. This change may offer improved tax efficiency but might also lead to higher implementation costs and increased complexity.
