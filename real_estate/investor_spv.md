# REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT SPV

This Investment SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) is designed to enable individual investors with limited investment capacity to own and benefit from one or more income-generating properties or development projects on track to become such assets. These properties may include multi-residential buildings, condo industrial warehouses, commercial plazas, and more.

This document serves as a guideline for legal experts to establish such a structure. The contents enclosed within [square brackets] are placeholders where NAMES, DATES, and NUMBERS should be inserted according to specific requirements.

It's important to note that implementing such a structure using corporate entities (or companies) is not considered tax-efficient within Ontario's jurisdiction. Replacing all instances of "INC." with a GP/LP partnership or a Trust could establish a tax flow-through structure. This change may offer improved tax efficiency but might also lead to higher implementation costs and increased complexity.

### [INCOME GENERATING PROPERTY]

The term [INCOME GENERATING PROPERTY] refers to an existing property capable of generating cash flow or to a property with a development plan aimed at becoming income-generating. This includes, but is not limited to, multi-residential buildings, industrial condominiums(condo warehouse), commercial plazas, and other similar properties. A specific example of an income-generating property is outlined as follows:

The [PROPERTY/PROJECT NAME], located at [PROPERTY ADDRESS], features [PROPERTY DESCRIPTION]. The current status of the property is [CURRENT STATUS]. The development plan(if applicable) is [DEVELOPMENT PLAN].


### [PROPERTY HOLDING INC.]

The term [PROPERTY HOLDING INC.] refers to an entity with the sole purpose of filling the following responsibilities:

- A. Holding the title to [INCOME GENERATING PROPERTY].

- B. Contracting [PROPERTY MANAGEMENT INC.] to manage the day-to-day operations of [INCOME GENERATING PROPERTY].

- C. Distributing income to shareholders.

This entity operates under the following restrictions:

- A. Retained Earnings are capped at a maximum of [n%] of the annual net income, ensuring the majority of the net income is distributed as dividends to shareholders.

- B. Beyond the management fee paid to the [PROPERTY MANAGEMENT INC.], operational costs are not to exceed [n%] of the annual gross income, reflecting its limited scope of responsibilities.


### [PROPERTY MANAGEMENT INC.]

[PROPERTY MANAGEMENT INC.] is contracted by [PROPERTY HOLDING INC.] to manage the [INCOME GENERATING PROPERTY]. 

Typical responsibilities include, but are not limited to, tenant management, rent collection, ensuring compliance with laws and regulations, maintenance, and marketing. Detailed responsibilities and compensation should be defined in the [Management Agreement].


### [OTHER SHAREHOLDERS]

[OTHER SHAREHOLDER(S)] are common shareholders of [PROPERTY HOLDING INC.], alongside [INVESTMENT SPV INC.]. Together, they own 100% of the common shares of [PROPERTY HOLDING INC.], representing their total equity interests in the [INCOME GENERATING PROPERTY].


### [INVESTMENT SPV INC.]

[INVESTMENT SPV INC.] is established as the entity within which diverse return plans can be executed to meet the varied objectives of different investor groups. Functioning as a special purpose vehicle, [INVESTMENT SPV INC.] is dedicated solely to performing specified investment services. Accordingly, there is no provision for retained earnings; all net income must be completely distributed to its shareholders in alignment with the stipulated investment terms.

Three classes of shares will be issued:

- Class A - Common Share
    - Endowed with full voting rights and designated for [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INC.], the Class A common share assigns the shareholder the responsibility of providing specified investor services to holders of Preferred Shares. This includes issuing cash distributions and providing reports and tax forms. Costs associated with these services are reimbursable but must not exceed [2%] of the total revenue. In the event of cost overruns, the management company is required to cover any shortfall.

- Class B - Preferred Share (Fixed Return)
    - With no voting rights, Class B preferred shares are designated for investors seeking a fixed investment return. Investors holding Class B preferred shares will receive a fixed [n%] return on cash distributions, non-compounding annually, and disbursed [quarterly].
    - In the event that the underlying [INCOME GENERATING PROPERTY] underperforms and does not generate sufficient net income to cover the fixed return for Class B preferred share investors, it is the responsibility of [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INC.] to cover the shortfall. Conversely, should the [INCOME GENERATING PROPERTY] overperform, resulting in excess net income beyond the fixed return for Class B preferred share investors, [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INC.] is entitled to retain the surplus.

- Class C - Preferred Share (Variable Return)
    - With no voting rights, Class C preferred shares are designated for investors seeking for a variable investment return. Investors with Class C preferred shares are entitled to a variable return on cash distributions, reflective of the performance and net income of the underlying [INCOME GENERATING PROPERTY].

In the event of liquidation, the liquidation preference ensures that investors with Class B and Class C (Preferred Share) see their investment principals prioritized over [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INC.], which possesses Class A (Common Share). In the scenario where assets remain post the settlement of all investment principals, the residual profits will be allocated among all three classes in accordance with their respective share percentages.
