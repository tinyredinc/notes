# Sysbench Benchmark Test

Unless you're using a standard product from a well-known cloud computing provider, it's always advisable to benchmark your system to check if its performance meets your expectations, particularly with new builds.

## Install Sysbench

```
sudo apt install sysbench
```

```
root@redhs88:/var/app# sysbench --version
sysbench 1.0.20
```
