### 3D Printing Filament
All our 3D-printed parts are made from high-quality PLA or PLA+ filaments with environmental considerations in mind. Polylactic Acid (PLA) is an environmentally responsible material, a bioplastic derived from renewable, plant-based sources such as corn, cassava, and sugarcane. However, PLA is not suitable for high-temperature applications, as it can deform at temperatures above 60Â°C. Additionally, it is not ideal for outdoor use, as direct sunlight can accelerate the aging and degradation of PLA.

### Tools and Tips
- Cross Screwdriver (required): The 92mm fan is mounted to the 3D-printed part using four small screws.
- Thick Double-Sided Tape or Hot Glue (required): The electronic modules and dustproof net can be secured with either double-sided tape or hot glue, but we recommend using double-sided tape.
- Utility Knife or Scissors (required): It is recommended to use a utility knife or scissors to trim the edges of the 3D-printed parts for a cleaner appearance.
- Pliers (optional): While the support structures of 3D-printed parts can be removed by hand, pliers can make the process easier and reduce the risk of injury from sharp plastic pieces.
- Hair Dryer (optional): 3D-printed parts typically have a margin of error of about 0.2mm, which can result in parts being "too tight" or "too loose" during assembly. Gently applying a bit of heat can soften the parts and make assembly easier.
- Sandpaper and Polisher (optional): Use these if you want to achieve a perfectly smooth and shiny surface.
