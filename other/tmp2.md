# Project: Setting Up Three Workstations

The goal is to establish workstations for three individuals while adhering to a budget of approximately $500 CAD. To achieve cost savings, we are permitted to make use of existing hardware and acquire used computer components.


## Solution

Considering the challenge of acquiring three decent computer sets within a $500 budget, whether new or used, we devised a solution involving a master host server and multiple RDP clients.

We discovered three spare, legacy HP SFF (Small Form Factor) PCs in storage. These were exceedingly slow and outdated, with Windows 10 system boot times surpassing 10 minutes. To improve performance, these PCs will be flashed to Ubuntu Linux and designated solely as RDP clients. We plan to assemble a host server boasting relatively solid specifications and robust performance using retired server parts from IDCs (Internet Data Centers), which will function as the master host server.

Maggie and Mark have well tested the final system. Users are assured a satisfactory computing experience through remote access to the master host server via our local Gigabit Ethernet. The current setup can support up to four users simultaneously: three using the RDP client PCs and one directly interacting with the master host. Equipped with 10 cores, 20 threads, and 64GB of RAM, the master host is well-prepared to accommodate additional users for basic work-related tasks, such as utilizing office applications, managing email, and browsing the web.

*Note 1: The expenditure of 2,038.96 CNY ($383.02 CAD) for used products and shipping from Taobao does not include official invoices. As a substitute, two invoices totaling $348.85 CAD from Canada Computers and Loblaws have been submitted for reimbursement.

*Note 2: The original budget was around $500. The primary reason for exceeding the budget is the urgent purchase of monitors and mice due to an important client's site visit. Brand new products, including taxes and environmental charges, cost significantly more than used products from Kijiji.
