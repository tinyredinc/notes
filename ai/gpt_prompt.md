# Frequently Used ChatGPT Prompts

I have extensively tested these prompts in my day-to-day work, and they should consistently deliver outstanding results. However, please be mindful of the potential for unpredictable outcomes when using AI-generated content and use them at your own risk.

## Translation

These prompts will generate two versions of the translation: Version 1 provides a word-for-word translation, while Version 2 delivers a more natural-sounding interpretation. For optimal results, combine these with human intelligence.

  Please translate the following paragraph(s) into Chinese and then rewrite it in a manner that sounds natural to a native Chinese speaker. The rewrite doesn't need to follow the original text word for word, as long as it conveys the same meaning：
  ```

  ```
  Please translate the following paragraph(s) into English and then rewrite it in a manner that sounds natural to a native English speaker. The rewrite doesn't need to follow the original text word for word, as long as it conveys the same meaning：

## Writing Aid

Different writing scenarios require varying degrees of manipulation in paragraphs. Sometimes, paragraphs need to be entirely rephrased with a completely different tone, such as turning drafted business terms into a legal document. However, at times it's better to retain as much of the original flavor and personal style as possible, like when writing a personal email. These prompts are designed to correct your writing while offering different levels of adaptation to your original writing style.

## Quiz

GPT is adept at handling quizzes across various fields, efficiently finding answers and explaining the reasoning behind them. You can use it to tackle practice quizzes found online that lack answers, or utilize its explanations as a valuable study aid. Keep in mind that although GPT typically scores high, it is not always 100% accurate.

*Note: You can repeat the question to GPT and check if the answers remain consistent.

*Note: For multiple-choice questions, GPT seems to struggle with handling options labeled as 1/2/3/4/5. It's better to convert these to A/B/C/D/E for clearer understanding.
