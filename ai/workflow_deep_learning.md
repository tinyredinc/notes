# Workflow for Deep Learning

The development of a Deep Learning (DL) model generally follows several phases. Here's a breakdown of common phases, which encompass the broader picture from conceptualization to deployment

## Problem Definition

- Understand and define the problem you aim to solve with AI.
- Determine the metrics for evaluating the model.

## Data Collection

- Collect and create a dataset that is representative of the problem you want to solve.
- This phase may include data gathering, annotation, and validation.

## Data Preprocessing

- Prepare your data for training by cleaning, normalizing, and transforming it into a format suitable for training the model.
- Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets.

## Model Design

- In most of the cases, You don't want/have to design an AI model from scretch.
- Choose the proper architecture of the neural network that fits your problem and data.
- Config the type of model (e.g., CNN, RNN, etc.), the number of layers, and other parameters.

## Training

- Train the model on your training dataset using an optimization algorithm to minimize the loss function.
- Utilize the validation set to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.

## Evaluation

- Evaluate the model's performance on a separate testing set to ensure it generalizes well to new, unseen data.
- Compare the modelâ€™s performance against the predefined metrics.

## Tuning

Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, etc., based on the performance on the validation set.

## Inference (or Deployment)

- Once the model is trained and evaluated, deploy it in a production environment where it can start taking in new data and making predictions or inferences.

## Maintenance and Upgrade

- Continuously monitor the model's performance in the production environment.
- Collect feedback and potentially retrain the model with new data to ensure its performance does not degrade over time.
